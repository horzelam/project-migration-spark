TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers.

After baking, it can be sanded, drilled, carved and painted with water-based acrylic paints or Sculpey Glaze. After coating with a few layers of the glaze*, you can use any paint you like to finish your piece. There are endless possibilities when creating with Sculpey.

That means that it shares many of the same properties as solid polymer clay but has a number of characteristics that offer unique and unexpected possibilities. TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers. Translucent Liquid Sculpey is available in a 2 oz bottle.</p>",

That means that it shares many of the same properties as solid polymer clay but has a number of characteristics that offer unique and unexpected possibilities. TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers. Translucent Liquid Sculpey is available in a 2 oz bottle.</p>",

When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers.

That means that it shares many of the same properties as solid polymer clay but has a number of characteristics that offer unique and unexpected possibilities. TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers. Translucent Liquid Sculpey is available in a 2 oz bottle.</p>",

That means that it shares many of the same properties as solid polymer clay but has a number of characteristics that offer unique and unexpected possibilities. TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers.

That means that it shares many of the same properties as solid polymer clay but has a number of characteristics that offer unique and unexpected possibilities. TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers. Translucent Liquid Sculpey is available in a 2 oz bottle.</p>",

That means that it shares many of the same properties as solid polymer clay but has a number of characteristics that offer unique and unexpected possibilities. TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers.

That means that it shares many of the same properties as solid polymer clay but has a number of characteristics that offer unique and unexpected possibilities. TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers.

After coating with a few layers of the glaze*, you can use any paint you like to finish your piece. There are endless possibilities when creating with Sculpey.

That means that it shares many of the same properties as solid polymer clay but has a number of characteristics that offer unique and unexpected possibilities. TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers. Translucent Liquid Sculpey is available in a 2 oz bottle.</p>",

That means that it shares many of the same properties as solid polymer clay but has a number of characteristics that offer unique and unexpected possibilities. TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers. Translucent Liquid Sculpey is available in a 2 oz bottle.</p>",

When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers.

That means that it shares many of the same properties as solid polymer clay but has a number of characteristics that offer unique and unexpected possibilities.

When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers.

That means that it shares many of the same properties as solid polymer clay but has a number of characteristics that offer unique and unexpected possibilities. TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers.

That means that it shares many of the same properties as solid polymer clay but has a number of characteristics that offer unique and unexpected possibilities. TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers.

TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers.

TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers.

TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers.

When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers.

That means that it shares many of the same properties as solid polymer clay but has a number of characteristics that offer unique and unexpected possibilities. TLS opens a whole new arena for artists and crafters alike! It is a \u201cbake-able\u201d transfer medium for the new millennium! When artist\u2019s oil paints are mixed with it, it can be an enamel, a glaze, or a backfilling compound. When pigments or mica powders are mixed with it, it can be a stipple, a metallic glaze, or a grout for polymer clay mosaics. TLS is also a fantastic transfer medium. It is a terrific adhesive agent. Its adhesive qualities are activated only after baking. It increases the clay to clay bond between raw layers of clay, and when adding raw layers to previously baked layers. Translucent Liquid Sculpey is available in a 2 oz bottle.</p>",
